Hobby/Interest: <b><i>Math</i></b>


<br/><br/><br/>

<tt>I've always really enjoyed doing math. It's really relaxing, and I find it fun. I enjoy working out a really long problem and trying to figure out the best way of doing things. Another great thing about math is that it's distracting, and it's a good way to distract yourself from more stressful things in life.</tt>
